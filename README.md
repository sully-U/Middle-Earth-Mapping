# Overview

This is my exploration of the GIS Mapping web application. The theme of the project is Lord of the Rings. Opening the application marks on a map the locations of several locations that were used as the inspiration for the films. The web app is interactive in the sese that you can zoom in and out and you can click on the markers and information will appear based on the location.

The primary purpose was to explore GIS Mapping but also to incorporate something that I truly love and that has inspired me since childhood.

# Development Environment

* Javascript
* IDE: Visual Studio Code
* Arcgis


# Useful Websites

* [GeoJSONLayer Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-GeoJSONLayer.html)
* [GeoJSONLayer Example](http://www.gistechsolutions.com/leaflet/DEMO/)
* [Popup Template Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-PopupTemplate.html#content)

# Future Work

* If you watched the video you will know I need to improve the popup so that it includes more information, specifically a picture.
* I would like to be able to translate the map of the globe to a map of middle earth using the same functionality.
* I might broaden the theme to just iconic movie film locations, for example the planet Endor from Star Wars Episode 6 was filmed in the Redwood forest outside of San Francisco.
